# 📄 Resume Categorizer using NLP
This project is a real-world NLP application that classifies uploaded PDF resumes into their respective professional categories such as Data Science, HR, DevOps, Testing, Web Development, etc. using RandomForestClassifier

# 📌 Project Overview
The Resume Categorizer allows users to upload their resume in PDF format. The app uses text extraction, text cleaning, and a pre-trained classification model to predict the job domain the resume best matches.

The model is trained on labeled resumes with proper NLP preprocessing and vectorization techniques like TF-IDF. It demonstrates how Natural Language Processing can be applied to real HR-tech use cases.

# 🧠 Key Features
✔ Coverting the PDF resume to text

✔ Cleaning the extracted data using regex

✔ Converting the cleaned text to vectors using TF-IDF

✔ Trained classifier (Train-Test split of 80/20)

✔ Used streamlit to create an app to allow user to upload PDF resume.
